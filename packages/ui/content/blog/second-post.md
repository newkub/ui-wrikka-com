# Best Practices for Writing Technical Documentation

Creating effective technical documentation is both an art and a science. In this post, we share our top tips for writing clear, concise, and useful documentation that developers will actually want to read.

## Know Your Audience

Before you start writing, it's crucial to understand who will be reading your documentation:

- What is their technical level?
- What are they trying to accomplish?
- What problems are they trying to solve?

## Structure Matters

Good documentation has a clear structure that helps readers find what they need quickly:

1. **Getting Started Guides** - Help users get up and running quickly
2. **Conceptual Guides** - Explain the "why" behind your product
3. **Reference Documentation** - Detailed information about APIs, configuration options, etc.
4. **Tutorials** - Step-by-step instructions for specific tasks

## Use Real Examples

Examples are worth a thousand words. Whenever possible, include real code examples that users can copy and paste:

```javascript
// Good example
function greetUser(name) {
  return `Hello, ${name}!`
}

// Bad example
function doSomething(param) {
  // This doesn't actually do anything
  return param
}
```

Following these practices will help you create documentation that users love and developers trust.
