# How We Achieved 99% Performance Improvement

Learn how we optimized our documentation platform to load 99% faster by leveraging Nuxt 3's server-side rendering and UnoCSS's atomic CSS approach.

## The Challenge

Our original documentation site was suffering from performance issues:

- Slow initial load times
- Large bundle sizes
- Poor mobile performance

## Our Optimization Strategy

We implemented several key optimizations:

### 1. Server-Side Rendering with Nuxt 3

By switching to Nuxt 3's SSR capabilities, we were able to:

- Reduce initial load times by 75%
- Improve SEO performance
- Provide better user experience for slow connections

### 2. Atomic CSS with UnoCSS

Moving to UnoCSS helped us:

- Reduce CSS bundle size by 90%
- Eliminate unused CSS
- Improve cache efficiency

### 3. Image Optimization

We implemented several image optimization techniques:

- Responsive images with srcset
- Modern formats like WebP
- Lazy loading for non-critical images

These optimizations combined to deliver a 99% improvement in load performance, making our documentation site blazingly fast.
